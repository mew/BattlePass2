# BattlePass2
Battle Pass EXP farmer. Gets about one level (tier) every 90 minutes.
### Usage
Use /bp2 to configure the settings and turn the mod on while in your housing. 
Make sure to disable the game pausing when you alt+tab if you want to leave it on in the background. This can be done by pressing f3+P on your keyboard while in game.
We've found you get the most EXP if you keep the delay on 3 seconds.

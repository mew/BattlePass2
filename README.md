# BattlePass2
Battle Pass EXP farmer. Gets about one level (tier) every 90 minutes. It's called *BattlePass2* because the original Battle Pass EXP farmer I made got patched. If you want that version for scientific reasons or something you can download it here
## Disclaimer
Because this mod loads a full dictionary, some generated words may be punishable to say in Hypixel chat.
I am not responsible if you get muted or banned for using this mod.
I have no idea if this will still work in the upcoming Battle Pass season. I will update this when it releases.
## Usage
Use /bp2 to configure the settings and turn the mod on while in your housing.
Make sure to disable the game pausing when you alt+tab if you want to leave it on in the background. This can be done by pressing f3+P on your keyboard while in game.
We've found you get the most EXP if you keep the delay on 3 seconds, but it can be altered to whatever you wish.
